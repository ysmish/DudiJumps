DudiJumps - Assembly Language Platform Game
Solo Development Project | x86 Assembly Language
Developed a fully functional retro-style platform jumping game from scratch using pure x86 Assembly language for DOS environment. The project demonstrates advanced low-level programming skills and comprehensive understanding of computer architecture.
Key Technical Achievements:

Graphics Engine: Implemented custom VGA graphics system with 320x200 resolution, direct memory manipulation, and BMP file loading with palette management
Game Physics: Designed real-time gravity and collision detection system using pixel-perfect algorithms for character movement and platform interaction
Memory Management: Developed efficient sprite rendering system with background saving/restoration and matrix-based object drawing
Input System: Created responsive real-time keyboard input handling using BIOS interrupts for smooth character control
Procedural Generation: Implemented pseudorandom platform generation system for dynamic level layouts in advanced stages

Game Features:

7 progressive difficulty levels with multiple platform types (standard, falling, spike, disappearing)
Complete game state management (start screen, instructions, gameplay, win/lose conditions)
Collectible system with heart pickups for level progression
Advanced movement mechanics including super jump and directional controls

Technical Skills Demonstrated:

Low-level programming and direct hardware interaction
File I/O operations and binary format handling (BMP)
Interrupt-driven programming and real-time system design
Algorithm implementation for collision detection and random generation
Memory optimization and efficient data structure usage

Development Environment: MASM Assembler, DOSBox, VGA Graphics Programming
This project showcases deep understanding of computer architecture, memory management, and the ability to create complex software using minimal abstractions.
